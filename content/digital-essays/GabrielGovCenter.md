While Government Center is now considered the heart of Boston's government, prior to the 1960s it represented a side of Boston that conflicted with the puritanical sensibilities that often characterized this city. In his completed [Government Center Urban Renewal Plan and final project report](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/book_viewer/commonwealth:1544mb47d#?xywh=-1450%2C1303%2C3526%2C2639&cv=), Boston Development Administrator Edward J. Logue succeeded at replacing what he characterized as "a notoriously decadent and dilapidated area," with the present day Government Center. The goal was to create a major center of government and private activity. The vast empty space of city hall plaza and the brutalist architectural design of the new city hall flattened a part of the city that was labeled degenerate. Nevertheless, while Government Center may have provided a new place for public gathering and political deliberation, its existence came at the cost of one of the cultural landmarks that characterized Boston's West End.

# Cultural Scene

Formerly known as Scollay Square, Government Center housed a lively theater, and comedy scene that entertained thousands of Bostonians for decades. One of the more controversial theatrical performances that were frequented in Scollay Square were the risqué Burlesque shows. While there were a variety of theaters that hosted these performances, the most famous was the [Howard Atheneaum](https://thewestendmuseum.org/history/era/west-boston/the-howard-athenaeum/), popularly known as the Old Howard Theater. In addition to the Old Howard Theater, there were the Crawford House, Star Theater, and Olympia Theater which competed with their own shows. Within Scollay Square there were a variety of other forms of entertainment to be found beyond just Burlesque shows. In fact, the Burlesque shows shot up in popularity around the 1920s, before then most theaters showed a variety of [vaudeville, slapstick comedy, circus performers, boxing matches, and pantomime](https://thewestendmuseum.org/history/era/immigrant-neighborhood/scollay-square/).

# LGBTQ+ History

One of the more important cultural dimensions of Scollay Square was the Nightlife. The area had a variety of taverns and bars that were frequented by residents and sailors who had landed in Boston. The bar scene had a particularly significant value to the lgbtq+ community during the first half of the 20th century. The Rialto, also known as the Star Theater, is an example of one of the locations that hosted bars that members of the lgbtq+ community would frequent as noted by the acclaimed study on the history of gay and lesbian history in Boston, *Improper Bostonians.* Overall, Scollay Square represented a side of Boston that did not sit well with the conservative elites.

### The Golden Tea Kettle

Not a lot remains of Old Scollay Square in Government Center today, but there a still a few remnants that can be visited today. One of the more interesting landmarks that can still be found includes the famous golden steaming tea kettle that can be found today at 63-65 Court St. However, this famous tea kettle was not always located in that spot. The Kettle was funded by the Oriental Tea company as a promotional gimmick. Therefore, on January 1, 1875 the fully functioning animatronic tea kettle was placed just above Oriental Tea at 85 and 87 Court St. Eventually, like the rest of Scollay Square, Oriental Tea did not survive, but the [tea kettle](https://www.boston.com/news/wickedpedia/2023/11/28/big-tea-kettle-government-center-starbucks-boston-ma/) would thanks to the owner at the time buying a location further down the road.

### John Winthrop Statue

The tea kettle's current location is at the corner of the sears crescent building which is one of the only remaining structures left over after the demolition of Scollay Square. This landmark's current location is near where the [John Winthrop Statue](https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=ariall&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!299655~!0#focus) stood in Scollay Square for over twenty years. The statue was cast in 1880 and placed at the heart of Scollay Square to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the founding of Boston. Due to increased traffic and construction of the subway, the statue was first moved further down the intersection, and then completely relocated to the First Church in Back Bay. Unfortunately, due to a fire that broke out in 1968, the statue sustained significant damage. The statue remains in storage today, but at the First Church there is a replica that can be visited. While a replica, it remains one of the few vestiges of the once historic entertainment center.

While little remains of Scollay Square, remembering the past helps us understand the present and appreciate the past. The story of Government Center would be incomplete without recognizing what stood before and how it eventually led to what exists today.
